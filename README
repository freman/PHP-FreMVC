# FreMVC

A light unobtrusive MVC (yes, yet another one)

I've found there to be plenty around but they're all heavier than I want or do more than I want.
This nice little MVC does exactly what I want with very little waste, making it ideal for tiny projects.

At the moment, it's not yet complete, I've written it mostly for a project I'm doing that has lots
of json api calls and so far has no web requests (hence the JsonController is complete but Controller isn't).

It's been built with APC in mind, right down to the way it requires files to not break APC's methods.
Having said that, there's no actual caching built in (yet)
